## Dedicated Server Hosting Guide

### introduction

Welcome, below you will find information on how to host a Mordhau dedicated server on Linux and Windows.

While the following guides and information tries to be as helpful as possible, you can also find additional resources and assistance over on the Mordhau Server Owner's Discord

Much of this information assumes that you are trying to host a server yourself, either on a local machine within your home network, or on a VPS or Dedicated server that you have rented. There is also a list of **Dedicated Game Server Providers** who offer their services to set up a server that can be managed more easily at an additional cost, usually through a website control panel.
